              <p>In Angular, a Component is a special kind of directive that uses a simpler configuration which is suitable for a component-based application structure.
              This makes it easier to write an app in a way that's similar to using Web Components or using Angular 2's style of application architecture.

              Advantages of Components:

              simpler configuration than plain directives
              promote sane defaults and best practices
              optimized for component-based architecture
              writing component directives will make it easier to upgrade to Angular 2
              When not to use Components:

              for directives that rely on DOM manipulation, adding event listeners etc, because the compile and link functions are unavailable
              when you need advanced directive definition options like priority, terminal, multi-element
              when you want a directive that is triggered by an attribute or CSS class, rather than an element</p>

              <p>In Angular, a Component is a special kind of directive that uses a simpler configuration which is suitable for a component-based application structure.
              This makes it easier to write an app in a way that's similar to using Web Components or using Angular 2's style of application architecture.

              Advantages of Components:

              simpler configuration than plain directives
              promote sane defaults and best practices
              optimized for component-based architecture
              writing component directives will make it easier to upgrade to Angular 2
              When not to use Components:

              for directives that rely on DOM manipulation, adding event listeners etc, because the compile and link functions are unavailable
              when you need advanced directive definition options like priority, terminal, multi-element
              when you want a directive that is triggered by an attribute or CSS class, rather than an element</p>
